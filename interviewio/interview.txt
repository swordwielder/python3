Help your interviewee get better! 
The candidate proposed some ideas in the right direction, yet progress was relatively slow. Some hints were given about an elegant approach. The second problem also appeared challenging. Communication could be slightly improved by explaining algorithm in more detail prior to coding.

The candidate understands CS fundamentals and I certainly see potential in the candidate. To continue practicing, the candidate can continue working with these algorithmic patterns:
 DFS/BFS
 greedy
 sliding window
 divide and conquer
 recursion
 dynamic programming.

A popular site to practice algorithms is leetcode.com. To ensure practice conditions close to the interview setting, I encourage
1. Code in a notepad
2. Setup a timer 
3. Talk during a practice
4. Create some psychological pressure, e.g. ask somebody to watch you during practice, record yourself on a video, etc.
